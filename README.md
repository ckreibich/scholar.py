Can get the whole results of searching on Google Scholar. 
Add some new functions:
    "python scholar.py -c 100 -T 6675397154864859782 --citation "bt" " and you will get the 100 results of articles which cited "3D Slicer as an image computing platform for the Quantitative Imaging Network"
    the name of journals will be saved into a json file
    the title of each articles will also be saved in a json file
    However, in many cases, Google will ban urllib to parse html and this is a problem that I am working on.
